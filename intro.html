<p>Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field[1] that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods,
processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy,
structured, or unstructured data.[2]

Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences,
information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research
paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]</p>
